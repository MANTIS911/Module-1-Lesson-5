                <h2>Facts about Dogs</h2>
                <p>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf.
                    Also called the domestic dog, it was domesticated from an
                    extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene,
                    over 14,000 years ago by hunter-gatherers, prior to the
                    development of agriculture. The dog was the first species
                    to be domesticated by humans.</p>
